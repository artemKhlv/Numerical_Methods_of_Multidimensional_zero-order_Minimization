# Numerical_Methods_of_Multidimensional_zero-order_Minimization
Numerical methods of multidimensional minimization of zero order for solving problems of multidimensional minimization by various numerical methods of zero order.

## Task:
It is required to find the absolute minimum of a function of many variables y = f(x1, . . . , xn), that is, a point x^* = Rn such that f(x^*) = min f(x)
